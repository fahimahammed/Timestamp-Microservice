# Timestamp Microservice

Build a full stack JavaScript application that processes and returns Unix and UTC timestamps for given dates, similar to the FreeCodeCamp Timestamp Microservice project.

## Features

- **Timestamp Conversion:**
  - Accepts a date string as a parameter and returns both Unix and UTC timestamps.
  
- **Date Parsing:**
  - Parses incoming date strings using `new Date()` assuming GMT dates.
  
- **UI/UX:**
  - Design a straightforward interface for entering dates and displaying timestamps.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap recommended), JavaScript (React or plain JS)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js

## Example Output

For a valid date string input, return:

```json
{
  "unix": 1483228800000,
  "utc": "Sun, 01 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT"
}
```

## Usage

- Access the deployed application and enter a date string to get its corresponding Unix and UTC timestamps.
